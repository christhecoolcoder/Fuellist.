# Fuellist

Fuellist is an energy drink tracker app where users can see keep track the energy drinks they consume on a daily basis and the amount of caffeine in each drink. Users can also discover new drinks they've never tried before by looking at the consumed drink lists of other users.

## Inspiration
As and avid energy drink consumer enthusiast myself, i thought it would be an interesting project to see just how much caffeine i consume on a weekly basisc through these drinks. I also want to see how many people in my social circle share the same love for energy drinks as i do and which drinks they prefer.
